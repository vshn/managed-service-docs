= Backup

== Linux Servers Backup

=== Software

The software used to create backups is https://burp.grke.org/[BURP (BackUp and Restore Program)].

The backup runs in multiple phases:

|===
| Phase
| Client
| Server
| Client Impact

| 0
| Running pre-backup scripts (for example, dump databases)
| n/a
| Degraded disk I/O performance

| 1
| Filesystem scan and send new stats (files, inodes, sizes) to the server
| Receive stats from the client
| Degraded disk I/O performance

| 2
| Send the changes that the server requests. The work of the client is now finished.
| Request and receive changes from the client and create an unchanged list and a changed list.
| Depending on available bandwidth this might have an impact on network I/O performance

| 3
| n/a
| Generate the new manifest list for the backup out of the unchanged list and the changed list.
| n/a

| 4
| n/a
| Finish off the backup by jiggling the received data around and putting everything in the correct place.
| n/a

=== Schedule

Backup runs daily between 22:00 and 07:00.

=== Contents

==== Default file set

The following directories are backed up on every server:

[source,bash]
--
/boot/grub
/etc
/home
/usr/local
/var/backups
/var/lib/dpkg
/var/log
/var/spool
--

==== Additional backup configuration

Depending on the software running on the server additional directories will be backed up. These come from the puppet profiles. In order to get a complete list of files that are backuped, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
--
$ egrep -h '(in|ex)clude' /etc/burp/burp* | sort
--

This will output a list of all directories included and excluded in/from the backup.

==== Pre / Post backup scripts

In order to have consistent backups, its necessary to run some pre-backup tasks. These may include dumping/locking databases, clear logs etc. To find out what jobs will be running, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
--
$ ls -l /usr/share/burp/{pre,post}-backup/
--

This will output a list of all script that are run before and after the backup.

For details on database backups see the following articles:

* xref:restore_mysql_burp.adoc[Restore MySQL/MariaDB with BURP]
* xref:postgresql_burp.adoc[PostgreSQL with BURP]
* xref:mongodb_burp.adoc[MongoDB with BURP]

=== Retention

We use the following retention policy:

* Keep the last 7 "daily" backups;
* Keep the last 4 "weekly" backups;
* This guarantees to keep 7 backups in a row, plus 4 on multiples of 7.

NOTE: Check the detailed description in the http://burp.grke.org/docs/retention.html[BURP documentation].

=== Location

In the default configuration managed servers are configured to backup to a off-site server. The following table lists the shared backup servers and their location:

[cols=4*,options="header",format=dsv]
|===
Name: Hardware Owner: ISP: Location
`backup1.cloudscale.vshn.net`: VSHN AG: cloudscale.ch AG: e-shelter datacenter, RÃ¼mlang, Switzerland
`backup9.lpg.cloudscale.vshn.net`: VSHN AG: cloudscale.ch AG: green.ch datacenter, Lupfig, Switzerland
`backup10.lpg.cloudscale.vshn.net`: VSHN AG: cloudscale.ch AG: green.ch datacenter, Lupfig, Switzerland
`backup11.lpg.cloudscale.vshn.net`: VSHN AG: cloudscale.ch AG: green.ch datacenter, Lupfig, Switzerland
`backup12.lpg.cloudscale.vshn.net`: VSHN AG: cloudscale.ch AG: green.ch datacenter, Lupfig, Switzerland

|===

To find out which backup server is used, check the server line in the burp client configuration:

[source,bash]
--
$ egrep '^server\s+=' /etc/burp/burp.conf
--

=== Encryption

* All data is encrypted on the client and the encrypted data is then sent to the backup server
* The data transport between the client and server is done over a TLS-encrypted connection
