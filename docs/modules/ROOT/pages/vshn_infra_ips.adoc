Required during initial server setup. Ubuntu repositories not available via HTTPS. apt-key doesn't support HTTPS.

*Workaround for package repositories*

Use https for the puppetlabs repository (works) and use https with a mirror that supports it instead of the Ubuntu repos, for example 'https://ftp.uni-mainz.de/ubuntu'.

*Workaround for key servers*

Export all keys on another server, copy via scp and import.
